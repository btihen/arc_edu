Our collection of resources are by no means exhaustive. If you are part of the agile movement in education, you may well have some immediate suggestions for us to include here. In each section there is a link so you can let us know of other possible resources. If you are new to agile, get ready to immerse yourself in ideas that may challenge some of your thinking about teaching and learning, as it has us.
