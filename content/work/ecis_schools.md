### ECIS member schools

Individuals and collaborative teams at ECIS member schools are invited to send proposals that document practices in:

Natural feedback (students receive feedback as a direct result of their work, e.g. a robot controlled garden grows healthy plants, not drying out or flooding);
Non-traditional formative feedback (e.g. from peers, through journaling, etc.)
Using Learning Analytics in agile learning environments
